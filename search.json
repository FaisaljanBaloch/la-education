    "text": "The map illustrates the spatial distribution of educational attainment across census tracts in Los Angeles County, specifically focusing on the percentage of adults with a bachelor’s degree or higher. Areas with higher concentrations of college-educated residents—such as Santa Monica, Pasadena, and coastal neighborhoods—appear in warmer colors like yellow and orange, indicating rates above 60%. In contrast, darker purple regions in the northern interior and parts of South and Southeast Los Angeles represent neighborhoods where fewer than 20% of adults hold a bachelor’s degree. The stark geographic disparities highlighted in the map reflect broader socioeconomic divides within the county, suggesting that access to higher education remains unevenly distributed. This visualization provides a powerful tool for identifying communities that may benefit from targeted educational resources or policy interventions."
